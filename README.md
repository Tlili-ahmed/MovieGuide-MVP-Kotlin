# Description
This an Android application written in Kotlin that showcases Uncle Bob Clean Architecture approach, MVP pattern, RxKotlin, Retrofit. 

It's ideal to get started with these concepts. Also, it could be used as a boilerplate.

To respect the clean architecture approach I got inspired from this [project](https://github.com/dmilicic/Android-Clean-Boilerplate)
